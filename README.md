# ML-Decision-Trees-Algo
This repo contains codes for Decision Trees algorithm in machine learning


### Decision Trees Algorithm in Machine learning  
* It is a Supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and Regression problems.  
* In this algo, the data is continuously split according to a certain parameter & tree can be explained by two entities, namely decision nodes and leaves.  
* In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making.  
* Here, in the code file we have worked on dataset : load_iris, imported from Scikit-learn library.
